# Image Editor

In this project, you can crop an image format file that you downloaded from your computer in line with different frames, apply defined effects, and perform rotation. After your operations are finished, the files are saved under the wwwroot folder. I will soon add some more improvements to this project, which I developed with the MVC approach using the ASP.Net Core framework.
